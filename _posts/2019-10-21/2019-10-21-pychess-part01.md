# Project: PyChess (Part 01)
### Introduction:
This project attempts an implementation of a full Chess game in Python. The scope will be divided into subparts, with gradual complexity, starting from a console based game, to complete GUI with animated controls.

Implementing chess is a well covered subject and no new developments might be achieved at the end. The project is intended to be a first experience in building a full application on a subject that is interesting to me. I will try to steer away form implementing/copying any other code, even if it means re-inventing the wheel.

The implementation of a chess game can be divided into two components, GUI and engine. The GUI will be as detailed as my progress will allow it, with a first implementation using pygame. Later on a more refined implementation using PyQt might be attempted. The engine will be implemented from scratch, but it will not be expected to offer much in terms of optimization or memory management. The details for building the AI are not completely clear at the moment, so it is harder to accurately measure the scope of this aspect of the project.

Part 01 will be responsable for collecting the related bibliography, which means it might be edited in the future.
